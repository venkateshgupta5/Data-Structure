    "What are the technical features of MySQL? \n",
    "A:MySQL database software is a client or server system which includes\n",
    "Multithreaded SQL server supporting various client programs and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why MySQL is used?\n",
    "A:MySQL database server is reliable, fast and very easy to use.  This software can be downloaded as freeware \n",
    "and can be downloaded from the internet.\n",
    "\n",

    "What are Heap tables?\n",
    "A:HEAP tables are present in memory and they are used for high speed storage on temporary basis.\n",

    "    \n",
    "What is the default port for MySQL Server?\n",
    "A:The default port for MySQL server is 3306.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the advantages of MySQL when compared with Oracle? \n",

    " Differentiate between FLOAT and DOUBLE?\n",
    "A:Floating point numbers are stored in FLOAT with eight place accuracy and it has four bytes.\n",
    " Floating point numbers are stored in DOUBLE with accuracy of 18 places and it has eight bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiate CHAR_LENGTH and LENGTH?\n",
    "A:CHAR_LENGTH  is character count whereas the LENGTH is byte count. The numbers are same for Latin \n",
    "characters but they are different for Unicode and other encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to represent ENUMs and SETs internally? \n",
    "A:ENUMs and SETs are used to represent powers of two because of storage optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the usage of ENUMs in MySQL?\n",
    "A:ENUM is a string object used to specify set of predefined values and that can be used during table creation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Foo ( color ENUM('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow') );\n",
    "\n",
    "This column allows you to store one of the values in the enum list, but no other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other databases besides MySQL, it's more typical to use a CHECK constraint \n",
    "to accomplish the same thing. A CHECK constraint is standard SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Foo ( color VARCHAR(6) CHECK (color IN ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow')) );\n"

    "\n",
    "The length of a CHAR column is fixed to the length that you declare when you create the table. \n",
    "The length can be any value from 0 to 255.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the difference between primary key and candidate key?\n",

    "A:Maximum size of Heal table can be controlled by MySQL config variable called max_heap_table_size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between MyISAM Static and MyISAM Dynamic?\n",
    "A:In MyISAM static all the fields will have fixed width. The Dynamic MyISAM table will have fields like \n",
    "TEXT, BLOB, etc. to accommodate the data types with various lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are federated tables?\n",
